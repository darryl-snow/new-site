	h2.o-section__header.o-section__header--blue--medium#services__header What I do

	p.c-services__text I’m a hyper-organised agile fanatic, and a certified Scrum Product Owner who genuinely geeks out on process. I’ve covered many roles in the industry, so fit well into any team, and have years of experience in building, managing, and training such digital product teams. What do I do? I work with great teams to make great products for the web and mobile devices.
